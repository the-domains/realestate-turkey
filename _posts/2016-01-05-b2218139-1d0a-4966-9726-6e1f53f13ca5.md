In previous years before 2012, Turkey had a strict reciprocity law in place which restricted many nationals from buying property in Turkey unless a Turkish national could in return, buy a home in that respected country.

However in May 2012 a new law was implemented by the Turkish government which lifted a large amount of these restrictions and opened the Turkish property market to nationals of more than 129 different countries.

Some rules still remain in place, such as real estate owned by a foreign national in a Turkish town can't exceed 10% of the town's land area and a foreign national can't purchase more than 300,000sqm of land in Turkey without first acquiring approval from the ministry of interior in Turkey.
